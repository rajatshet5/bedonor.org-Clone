If no measures are taken to address this issue, many will die of starvation & suffering.\n\n\n\nWe have launched an initiative to feed the stray dogs of Nasik on a mission mode and save their lives we started feeding from 20 st October , 2020 in some areas . However as observed, street dogs are starving due to no availability of food throughout the city. Hence, we are expanding our reach and trying to cover most areas possible in Nasik.\n\n\n\nLooking at the current situation of stray dogs we are feeding them at between 7-11 am as well as 7-10 at night. As of now , We are feeding biscuits , eggs , rice , as its nutritional. Moreover , we also make sure there is enough water available for them . We keep pots made of mud where dogs are densely populated .\n\n\n\nWe also hope you are doing your bit to feed stray dogs in your area . Our activity is limited in Nasik , If you are situated anywhere else you can help by feeding them Individually or collectively. \n\n\n\nWe appreciate your contribution towards our small initiative to feed stray dogs.\n\n\n\nDon't let them starve.",

      "details": "It came in as a shock of the lifetime for Mohit’s family when he suddenly went unconscious at the age of 6 \nand it’s as hard to say as it is to believe, it’s been 7 years now and Mohit is still in bed. He suffered from \nsevere brain damage at the age of 6 and he’s been battling the pain since then. Who would have known that a boy \nso full of life will become almost dead or unconscious suddenly after this severe brain degeneration disease \ncalled 'Cerebral atrophy' due to uncontrolled “Epilepsy”? One cannot even imagine the pain, frustration, and \nmisery of being in bed for 7 years and totally dependant on the family to help you with every basic need.\n\nHis body is fully spastic and stiff. He is unable to express any emotions, talk even a single word, doesn’t \nrecognise anyone, and cannot even move a single finger. He is facing such a critical situation for more than 7 \nyears. Just crying always in low sound and feel that now this child can’t tolerate pain and struggle more to \nlive such life.\n\nMohit's mother says- 'As a mother, it is very difficult to see my child in this situation and I always remember \nthat Mohit was so fond of flying kites. He once told me that he also wants to fly and wants to be a and now he \nis fully crippled due to this life-threatening brain degenerative disease.'\n\nMohit's father says 'Who knows that how these circumstances suddenly arrived in my son’s life and my normal \nson got fully paralysed at the age of 6 years. I have fulfilled all the responsibilities as a father, consulted \nall local doctors, took him to all the hospitals I possibly could’ve. I work at a local sweet shop and barely \nearn a living for my family, even then I did my best and spent everything I had, even I lost my house and all \nthe savings for his treatment. Yet there’s no improvement, there’s no change in the progression of his condition \nand I’m left with nothing to spend on further treatments.'\n\nCerebellar Atrophy is also called cerebellar degeneration in which neurons (nerve cells) in the cerebellum - the \narea of the brain that controls coordination and balance - deteriorate and die. It sometimes affects congenital-related \nissues if it involves the damage of some other major brain cells. Diseases that cause cerebellar degeneration \ncan also involve other areas of the central nervous system, including the spinal cord, medulla oblongata, \ncerebral cortex.\n\nThere is no conventional cure for the disease. But doctors suggest that Some advanced medical treatment with \nlong-term supportive care (rehabilitation /physiotherapy) can improve muscle power and other brain development \ngrowth.\n\nSome experienced neuro consultant and orthopaedic doctors have advised some advanced medical treatment with \nfull supportive care (for a minimum of 6 months) to help recover my son and this is the only hope we’re now left with. \nHe probably will get better but the treatment is very expensive, the estimated cost would be 40 lakhs approximately. \nIn which such advanced medical treatment cost is 25 Lacs and then remaining rehabilitation and other joints related surgery \nwould be 15 lacks approx.\n\nNo one deserves to live a life like that. We urge everyone who reads this story to do their bit in saving a life. \nPlease show your support by donating as much as you can out of pure goodwill. Your little efforts can save someone's life \nand bring joy to the lives of those around him.",

      "details": "It was no surprise that there would be mass destruction when authorities confirmed the movement of cyclone Yaas towards the state of Odisha and Bengal. State and Central government prepared well enough to save hundreds of lives and move them to safer locations, but it wasn’t enough for some locals. Some lost their homes, some lost their animals, and were left stranded with no resources to support their livelihood. One such example came out from the Chandapur village in the Ganjam district of Odisha. A local resident and social worker, Mr. Piresh Lima, surveyed the cyclone-affected region, and it was he who found out about the misery of these 25 families in Chandapur village.\nMost of these families have no men to share the responsibility of the household and are being run by the widows. For years they’ve been working as labourers or were indulge in other menial jobs to support their families and feed their children. It is one classic example of a woman’s sheer will and determination to earn a living for her children with no support whatsoever. Yet, all their efforts and hard work were of no use after the lockdown first hit them and snatched away any opportunity to work and earn themselves a living. Still, they were determined as ever and didn’t lose their hopes; their animals became their saviours, and they found a way out of their misery; they started selling milk to earn their bread. It was until the Cyclone Yaas shattered all their hopes, they were left with no place to live, no animals to survive upon, and no resources to fuel their livelihood. They were forced to relocate and live the worst of life one could imagine with no proper roof and not even the sound four walls to be called home; it was all broken sheds made of bamboo and plastic sheets to cover. Their children have no means to attain education, and the widows have no idea how they’re going to feed them. Each passing day is now becoming a challenge, and it’s easier said than done to face and overcome these challenges empty stomach.\nWith the help of Be Donor Crowdfunding platform, Mr. Piresh Lima has extended its support to these families, and initiating a fundraiser to raise funds for these widows. They deserve a better life, their hard work deserves its reward, their children deserve an education, and we hope that everyone out there would donate generously to this cause. Your mere donation would go a long way in giving these people a better life.\nWe’re currently living in very challenging times, and the only way out of it is to support each other and jump out on the winning side together. We urge everyone to come forward and please support Piresh Lima in their initiative to help and support these widowed women and their families. What they’re appealing for is urgent, and we need to act as soon as possible.\n",

He is struggling to even take a look in the mirror. His face is so badly burnt that he is not able to meet anyone. His life has accumulated in a room. I took him to a hospital and they have done all initial treatment and now doctor has suggested for plastic surgery as his face was very badly burnt. I am farmer and have no money for the plastic surgery. \n\n\n\nWe have spent our all initial savings for his medical treatment and even i had to take loan of 3 lakh for his initial surgical treatment but now i don't have funds to get this plastic surgery done for my son. The money is now over and the interest is increasing day by day. The doctors have said that the further plastic surgery treatment will cost around 10,00,000 Lacks Indian Rupees. Mentioning the amount as hefty as 10 Lacks or 1 million is yet to be arranged is decreasing the chance of getting his  innocent smile back. But I hope people reading this would come forward and help my 5-year-old child. The doctors said that as he is very young the bruises can get healed but delay will only make the situation worst.\n\nWhat can I do alone? The answer is simple NOTHING but with a little support of you all I can have my child’s childhood back. Financially my condition is not able to support my child treatment as I do not have money. You all help me, help my 5-year-old sun to live a normal life. We are in need of 10 lakh rupees. Please extend your support towards our situation. Being a father I am asking you people to save my child’s life. Your mere donation can change his entire life and will help him to get required surgeries. Please do whatever possible from your side. I’ll be always be grateful for your help.",
